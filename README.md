This is a Currency Convertor code that converts multiple currencies to US Dollars.
The logic has been designed using two text-based files located in Drive 'D', in a folder named 'RC'. One file(Currency.txt) contains the Currency names that can be converted and the other file (Currency_Convertor) contains the exchange rates of the currencies and their symbols. 
For running the code succesfully, it needs to be able to access the files, so the location must be the same as I explained (Drive 'D', Folder 'RC', two text based files 'Currency.txt' and 'Currency_Convertor.txt')
Steps:
1. Make a folder named 'RC' in Drive 'D' your PC.
2. Save the attached files in that folder with the names (Currency.txt) and (Currency_Convertor.txt).
3. Run the code and follow the Commands to get the desired result.
